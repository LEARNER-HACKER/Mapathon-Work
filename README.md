# Mapathon-Work
AI-powered smart parking detection system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV to identify real-time parking slot occupancy from images and video.
# 🚗 AI-Based Smart Parking Detection System

## 📌 Overview
This project is a computer vision-based smart parking system developed during a hackathon. It detects vehicle occupancy in parking lots using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Urban areas face parking congestion due to lack of real-time parking visibility.

## 💡 Solution
Our system:
- Detects vehicles using YOLOv8
- Identifies parking slot boundaries
- Classifies slots as Occupied or Available
- Stores results in structured format (CSV/JSON)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8
- Docker
